# Startup-Success-Prediction

Startups are becoming one of the main drivers of the global economy. Google, Apple, Facebook, Airbnb or Uber are just a few examples of companies that started off as startups and that now have a major impact on our daily lives. But how can we predict what the next big thing will be? Can we actually foresee which startup has the best chance at success? What is success for a startup? 

In this project, we will attempt to create a model that can predict which startups will be successful based on the past performance of similar firms. As a starting threshold, we will consider those who had an IPO as successful. 

After that, we will train a Machine Learning model that will help us predict the future performance of the selected startups. We will then split the dataset into two main groups based on their level of execution.

As a starting point, we will consider those with the highest earnings in the first quarter after their IPO as the startups with the most potential to succeed. We have gotten our data from CrunchBase.
